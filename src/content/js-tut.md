## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding in JavaScript, you need to set up your development environment. You can use any text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. Additionally, you will need a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to run and test your JavaScript code.

## Basic Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program. Here are some basic syntax rules:

- Statements end with a semicolon (`;`).
- Code blocks are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).
- Variables are declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

Example:
```javascript
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);
